# Catink123's Neovim Config
This is a simple Neovim config that I use for web-development and other stuff.

To install it, clone this repo to your local machine and run the bootstrapper script.
```sh
$ ./setup-debian.sh
```
This bootstrapper script updates/installs Neovim, then installs Node.js and Yarn package manager.

After the script finishes installing neccesary tools for Neovim plugins to work properly, open Neovim and run `:SetupConfig` command.

You're now ready to use the config!
